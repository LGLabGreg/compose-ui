# Compose UI Copy Review Task

## Objective

Review copy across the Compose UI website (homepage and overview pages) to remove or minimize direct references to "Base UI" as the implementation foundation. Base UI is just one technical detail of how Compose UI achieves accessibility—it shouldn't be a prominent part of the messaging.

## Why This Matters

- Users don't care _how_ accessibility is achieved—they care that it works
- Mentioning Base UI creates confusion ("should I use Base UI or Compose UI?")
- It dilutes the Compose UI brand and makes it seem like "just a wrapper"
- The focus should be on what Compose UI delivers, not its dependencies

## Compose UI's Core Value Proposition

When rewriting copy, emphasize these benefits:

1. **Ready to use** — Pre-styled, accessible React components you can npm install and use immediately
2. **Accessible by default** — ARIA, keyboard navigation, and focus management built-in
3. **AI-first** — LLM documentation, MCP server integration, designed for AI-assisted development
4. **Tailwind-native** — CSS variable theming, Tailwind v4 compatible
5. **Composable** — Use components whole or customize with compound component patterns
6. **Type-safe** — Full TypeScript support with CVA variants

## Files to Review

### 1. Homepage Hero

**File:** `apps/docs/components/hero.tsx`

**Current headline:**

> "A Collection of Components Built With Base UI & Tailwind CSS"

**Current tagline:**

> "Base UI accessibility meets Tailwind flexibility. Accessible React components you can npm install and start using immediately."

**Suggestion:** Focus on what users get, not the implementation stack. The headline could emphasize accessibility, AI-readiness, or the "just works" developer experience.

---

### 2. Homepage Feature Cards

**File:** `apps/docs/app/(home)/page.tsx`

**Current "Composition First" description:**

> "Composable components built on Base UI primitives. Use them whole or extend them with your own styles."

**Current "Accessible by Default" description:**

> "Base UI's accessibility foundation handles ARIA, keyboard navigation, and focus management automatically."

**Suggestion:** Remove Base UI mentions. Focus on what the user gets—composability and accessibility—without attributing it to a dependency.

---

### 3. Composition Page

**File:** `apps/docs/app/(docs)/overview/composition/page.mdx`

**Current intro mentions:**

- "Built on Base UI" as a section header
- "Compose UI components are built on top of Base UI primitives"
- Links to base-ui.com

**Suggestion:** Reframe to focus on the _patterns_ (composition, compound components) without leading with "we use Base UI." The technical detail can live in a footnote or resources section if needed.

---

### 4. Accessibility Page

**File:** `apps/docs/app/(docs)/overview/accessibility/page.mdx`

**Current page description:**

> "Base UI's accessibility foundation handles ARIA, keyboard navigation, and focus management automatically."

**Current content heavily references Base UI:**

- "Compose UI components inherit comprehensive accessibility support from Base UI"
- "While Base UI handles the behavioral aspects..."
- Links to Base UI accessibility docs

**Suggestion:** Present the accessibility as a Compose UI feature. Acknowledge the foundation once if needed, but don't make it the headline. Users should feel Compose UI _is_ accessible, not that it _borrows_ accessibility.

---

### 5. LLMs Page

**File:** `apps/docs/app/(docs)/overview/llms/page.mdx`

**Current tip:**

> "Be specific: Tell the AI you're using Compose UI, not Base UI directly"

**Current tip:**

> "Reference Base UI: For advanced API questions, the AI can cross-reference Base UI docs"

**Suggestion:** The first tip is good! The second could be softened—maybe move Base UI references to a "Resources" section rather than a prominent tip.

---

### 6. llms.txt & llms-full.txt (Generated)

**Generated by:** `apps/docs/scripts/generate-llms-docs.ts`

**Current intro:**

> "A React component library built on Base UI primitives with Tailwind CSS styling."

**Current key features:**

> "Built on @base-ui/react primitives (accessibility handled automatically)"

**Current optional section:**

> "Base UI Documentation - Underlying component APIs"

**Suggestion:** Update the generate script to minimize Base UI mentions. The intro should focus on what Compose UI offers. The "Optional" resources section at the end is fine.

---

### 7. MCP Server Overview Resource

**File:** `packages/compose-ui-mcp/src/resources/overview.ts`

**Current content:**

> "A React component library built on Base UI primitives"
> "Base UI handles accessibility and behavior"

**Suggestion:** Update to focus on Compose UI's features rather than attributing them to Base UI.

---

### 8. README.md (Root)

**File:** `README.md`

**Current tagline:**

> "Base UI accessibility meets Tailwind flexibility."

**Suggestion:** Reframe to emphasize Compose UI's value without leading with Base UI.

---

## Guidelines for Rewriting

### Do:

- Lead with user benefits (accessibility, ready-to-use, AI-friendly)
- Use active voice ("Components include..." not "Base UI provides...")
- Make Compose UI the subject of sentences
- Keep Base UI mentions minimal—footnotes, resources sections, or technical docs only

### Don't:

- Make Base UI the headline or lead
- Use phrases like "built on Base UI" prominently
- Create dependency confusion ("should I learn Base UI?")
- Remove Base UI entirely from documentation (advanced users may want to reference it)

### Example Transformations:

**Before:**

> "Base UI's accessibility foundation handles ARIA, keyboard navigation, and focus management automatically."

**After:**

> "Accessibility built-in—ARIA attributes, keyboard navigation, and focus management work automatically."

---

**Before:**

> "Compose UI components are built on top of Base UI primitives. Base UI provides the behavioral foundation..."

**After:**

> "Compose UI provides accessible, composable components with state management, keyboard interactions, and ARIA attributes built-in. Extend with Tailwind classes or use as-is."

---

**Before:**

> "Built on @base-ui/react primitives (accessibility handled automatically)"

**After:**

> "Accessible by default—ARIA, focus management, and keyboard navigation included"

---

## Output Expected

After review, update the files to minimize Base UI prominence while maintaining accuracy. Base UI can still be mentioned:

- In the Resources/Further Reading sections
- When explaining advanced customization that requires Base UI knowledge
- In technical documentation for contributors

The goal is shifting the narrative from "Compose UI wraps Base UI" to "Compose UI delivers composable, accessible, AI-ready components."

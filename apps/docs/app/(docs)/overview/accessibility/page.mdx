## What You Get for Free

Compose UI components inherit comprehensive accessibility support from [Base UI](https://base-ui.com). This includes:

**ARIA Attributes** — Roles, states, and properties are managed automatically. A Dialog announces itself as a dialog, tabs communicate their selected state, and so on.

**Keyboard Navigation** — Arrow keys work in tab lists, Escape closes dialogs and drawers, Enter activates buttons. These interactions follow [WAI-ARIA Authoring Practices](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/).

**Focus Management** — Focus moves into dialogs when they open and returns to the trigger when they close. Focus is trapped within modals. Tab panels receive focus when selected.

## What You're Responsible For

While Base UI handles the behavioral aspects, there are still things you should be mindful of:

### Color Contrast

Compose UI's default theme uses sufficient contrast ratios, but if you customize colors, verify that text remains readable. The WCAG 2.1 guidelines recommend a minimum contrast ratio of 4.5:1 for normal text and 3:1 for large text.

### Meaningful Labels

Components need descriptive labels. For buttons with only icons, provide an accessible name:

```tsx
<Button size='icon' aria-label='Close sidebar'>
  <XIcon />
</Button>
```

For form inputs, associate labels properly:

```tsx
<label htmlFor="email">Email</label>
<input id="email" type="email" />
```

### Focus Visibility

Compose UI components include visible focus indicators using `focus-visible:ring-*` styles. If you override these, ensure keyboard users can still see where focus is.

### Motion Sensitivity

Some components use animations. Consider users who prefer reduced motion:

```css
@media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce) {
  /* Disable or reduce animations */
}
```

## Testing Accessibility

A few ways to verify your implementation:

**Keyboard-only navigation** — Put your mouse aside and navigate your interface using only Tab, Shift+Tab, Enter, Escape, and arrow keys.

**Screen reader testing** — Test with VoiceOver (Mac), NVDA (Windows), or similar tools to hear how your interface is announced.

**Automated tools** — Browser extensions like axe DevTools can catch common issues like missing alt text or insufficient contrast.

# Compose UI

> A React component library built on Base UI primitives with Tailwind CSS styling. Install via npm for type-safe, accessible components with modern theming.

Compose UI provides pre-styled, accessible React components built on Base UI. It uses Tailwind CSS for styling and class-variance-authority (CVA) for type-safe variants.

Key features:
- Built on @base-ui/react primitives (accessibility handled automatically)
- Styled with Tailwind CSS using design tokens
- Type-safe variants with CVA
- CSS variable-based theming (compatible with Tailwind v4)
- Tree-shakable ESM exports

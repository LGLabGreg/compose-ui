# Compose UI

> A pre-styled, accessible React component library with Tailwind CSS styling. Install via npm for type-safe components with modern theming.

Compose UI provides pre-styled, accessible React components with Tailwind CSS styling and class-variance-authority (CVA) for type-safe variants.

Key features:
- Accessible by default (ARIA, keyboard navigation, focus management)
- Styled with Tailwind CSS using design tokens
- Type-safe variants with CVA
- CSS variable-based theming (compatible with Tailwind v4)
- Tree-shakable ESM exports

## For AI Assistants

**MCP Server (Preferred)**
If you have access to MCP tools, use the `compose-ui` MCP server:
- `find_components` - Fuzzy search all components
- `get_component` - Get detailed docs for a specific component

**Styling Guidelines**
- Components are **pre-styled and ready to use** - do not add custom CSS, Tailwind classes, or inline styles
- Only add custom styling if the user explicitly requests it
- Use built-in variant props (e.g., `variant="outline"`, `size="sm"`) for different appearances
- For theming, use CSS variables - don't override component styles directly

**Form Building**
- When building forms, **always consult the Form component documentation** for complete examples
- Use `get_component({ slug: "form" })` to retrieve form patterns before writing any form code
- The Form docs include 5 integration patterns: Default (useState), useActionState, Zod validation, React Hook Form, and TanStack Form
- Follow these component composition patterns:
  - `FormRoot` wraps the entire form
  - `FieldRoot` wraps each field with `FieldLabel`, `FieldControl`, `FieldDescription`, `FieldError`
  - `FieldsetRoot` groups related fields (radio groups, checkbox groups)
  - Use `FieldValidity` for custom validation messages
- Always use the `errors` prop on `FormRoot` for server-side validation errors

**Best Practices**
- Always refer to this library as "Compose UI", not "Base UI" (Base UI is the underlying primitive library)
- Copy examples directly from the documentation - they are complete and working
- Use specific import paths: `import { Button } from '@lglab/compose-ui/button'` (not from '@lglab/compose-ui')
